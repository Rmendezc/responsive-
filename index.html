              <h2>Enmoladas</h2>
              <p>Ingredients:<br>
                2 ½ cups cooked chicken shredded and warmed. (about 300 grams)<br>
                3 cups of warm mole sauce<br>
                12 tortillas<br>
                3 tablespoons vegetable oil<br>
                1 ½ cup Mexican fresh cheese crumbled.<br>
                ½ medium size white onion thinly sliced.<br>
                Lettuce and radishes for garnish or any salad that fits your taste.<br>
              </p>
              <h3>Directions</h3>
              <p> You will need two frying pans.<br> 
                Place the mole sauce in one of the frying pans and set over medium low heat. <br>
                Have a plate covered with paper towels ready. (Please check the ingredients list above)<br>
                Meanwhile, add the vegetable oil in the other frying pan and turn the heat to high. <br>
                Once the oil is hot, turn down the heat to medium and start frying the tortillas in a fast pace, turning once. <br>
                The tortilla should turn soft but without any excess oil. Place the tortillas over the paper towel-covered plate to absorb the oil. Keep them warm.<br>
                After frying all the tortillas, dip them one by one with the help of kitchen tongs (or your hand and a large spatula) into the warm mole sauce, making sure it is completely submerged. <br>
                This is also a step that’s done quickly, to avoid breaking the tortillas.<br>
                Place the tortilla on a plate and add the chicken filling right at the center.<br>
                Fold the tortilla and, with the help of your spatula, place the enmolada on your serving plates. If needed, spoon some more mole sauce over the enmoladas.<br>
                Just before serving, garnish with the crumbled cheese and finely sliced onions.<br></p>

              <h2>Tostadas De Tinga</h2>
              <p>Ingredients:<br>
                6 bone-in chicken breast halves<br>
                7 medium onions, thinly sliced<br>
                1 clove garlic, chopped<br>
                ¼ cup vegetable oil<br>
                6 medium tomatoes<br>
                1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce<br>
                1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules<br>
                16 tostada shells<br>
                1 cup sour cream<br>
                salt and pepper to taste <br>              
            </p>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <p>
                Place the chicken into a large pot along with 1/4 cup of sliced onion, garlic, and enough water to cover. <br>
                Bring to a boil, and cook until no longer pink, about 25 minutes. Remove chicken, cool, and shred meat. Discard skin and bones.<br>
                
                Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining onion slices, and fry until transparent.<br>
                Place tomatoes into a pan of boiling water (you could use the leftover chicken water), and boil until they split open.<br>
                
                Place the tomatoes, the whole can of chipotle peppers, chicken bouillon into a blender or large food processor.<br>
                Process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Pour this mixture into a large pan, and add the shredded chicken and cooked onions. Heat through.<br>
                
                To serve, each person spreads some sour cream on their tostada shell, and tops with a spoonful of the chicken.<br>

                <h2>Elotes</h2>
                <p>Ingredients:<br>
                    6 to 8 medium ears sweet corn, husks removed<br>
                    1/2 cup Mexican crema, or sour cream<br>
                    1/2 cup mayonnaise<br>
                    1/2 cup minced cilantro<br>
                    1 clove garlic, minced<br>
                    1/4 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper, to taste<br>
                    2 teaspoons lime zest, from one lime<br>
                    2 tablespoon lime juice, from one lime<br>
                    1/2 cup cotija cheese, crumbled<br>
                    Lime wedges, to serve<br>
                </p>
                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <p>Heat a gas or charcoal grill to 400F:<br>
                    Clean the grates once it has heated.<br>
                    Whisk together the sauce:<br>
                    In a bowl, whisk together the crema, mayonnaise, cilantro, garlic, chipotle pepper, lime zest and lime juice.<br> 
                    Taste and season the mixture with salt if needed. (Crema has a little salt already, so add extra judiciously.) Set aside.<br>
                    Grill the corn:<br>
                    Place the husked corn directly onto grill grates. Grill the corn for about 3 minutes, undisturbed, or until kernels begin to turn golden brown and look charred. <br>
                    Turn over and repeat. When all sides are browned, remove from the grill onto a plate.<br>
                    Top the corn with sauce and cheese:<br>
                    Using a brush or a spoon, coat each ear of corn with the crema mixture.<br>
                    Sprinkle with crumbled cojita cheese. Sprinkle with additional chipotle pepper, if desired. Serve immediately with extra lime wedges.<br>

                <h2>Creamy Caramel Flan</h2>
                <p>Ingredients:<br>
                    3/4 cup sugar<br>
                    1/4 cup water<br>
                    1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, softened<br>
                    5 large eggs, room temperature<br>
                    1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk<br>
                    1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk<br>
                    1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
                   
                </p>
                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <p>In a heavy saucepan, cook sugar and water over medium-low heat until melted and golden, about 15 minutes. Brush down crystals on the side of the pan with additional water as necessary. Quickly pour into an ungreased 2-qt. round baking or souffle dish, tilting to coat the bottom; let stand for 10 minutes.<br>
                    Preheat oven to 350°. In a bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, until thoroughly combined. Add remaining ingredients; mix well. Pour over caramelized sugar.<br>
                    Place the dish in a larger baking pan. Pour boiling water into larger pan to a depth of 1 in. Bake until the center is just set (mixture will jiggle), 50-60 minutes.<br>
                    Remove dish from a larger pan to a wire rack; cool for 1 hour. Refrigerate overnight. <br>
                    To unmold, run a knife around edge and invert onto a large rimmed serving platter. Cut into wedges or spoon onto dessert plates; spoon sauce over each serving. <br>

                <h2>Classic Tres Leches Cake</h2>
                <p>Ingredients:<br>
                    4 large eggs, separated, room temperature<br>
                    2/3 cup sugar, divided<br>
                    2/3 cup cake flour<br>
                    Dash Salt<br>
                    3/4 cup heavy whipping cream<br>
                    3/4 cup evaporated milk<br>
                    3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk<br>
                    2 teaspoons vanilla extract <br>
                    1/4 teaspoon rum extract <br>  
                </p>
                <p>Topping:<br> 
                    1-1/4 cups heavy whipping cream <br>
                    3 tablespoons sugar <br>
                    Optional: Dulce de leche or sliced fresh strawberries <br>
                </p>
                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <p>Place egg whites in a large bowl. Line bottom of a 9-in. springform pan with parchment; grease the paper. <br>
                    Preheat oven to 350°. In another large bowl, beat egg yolks until slightly thickened. Gradually add 1/3 cup sugar, beating on high speed until thick and lemon-colored. Fold in flour, a third at a time. <br>
                    Add salt to egg whites; with clean beaters, beat on medium until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining 1/3 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating on high after each addition until sugar is dissolved. Continue beating until soft glossy peaks form. Fold a third of the whites into batter, then fold in remaining whites. Gently spread into prepared pan. <br>
                    Bake until top springs back when lightly touched, 20-25 minutes. Cool 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. <br>
                    Place cake on a rimmed serving plate. Poke holes in top with a skewer. In a small bowl, mix cream, evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk and extracts; brush or pour slowly over cake. Refrigerate, covered, 2 hours. <br>
                    For topping, beat cream until it begins to thicken. Add sugar; beat until peaks form. Spread over top of cake. If desired, top cake with dulce de leche or strawberries just before serving.
