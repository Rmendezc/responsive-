            <h2>Enmoladas</h2>
            <p>Ingredients:<br>
                2 ½ cups cooked chicken shredded and warmed. (about 300 grams)<br>
                3 cups of warm mole sauce<br>
                12 tortillas<br>
                3 tablespoons vegetable oil<br>
                1 ½ cup Mexican fresh cheese crumbled.<br>
                ½ medium size white onion thinly sliced.<br>
                Lettuce and radishes for garnish or any salad that fits your taste.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <p>
                You will need two frying pans.<br> 
                Place the mole sauce in one of the frying pans and set over medium low heat. <br>
                Have a plate covered with paper towels ready. (Please check the ingredients list above)<br>
                Meanwhile, add the vegetable oil in the other frying pan and turn the heat to high. <br>
                Once the oil is hot, turn down the heat to medium and start frying the tortillas in a fast pace, turning once. <br>
                The tortilla should turn soft but without any excess oil. Place the tortillas over the paper towel-covered plate to absorb the oil. Keep them warm.<br>
                After frying all the tortillas, dip them one by one with the help of kitchen tongs (or your hand and a large spatula) into the warm mole sauce, making sure it is completely submerged. <br>
                This is also a step that’s done quickly, to avoid breaking the tortillas.<br>
                Place the tortilla on a plate and add the chicken filling right at the center.<br>
                Fold the tortilla and, with the help of your spatula, place the enmolada on your serving plates. If needed, spoon some more mole sauce over the enmoladas.<br>
                Just before serving, garnish with the crumbled cheese and finely sliced onions.<br>

            <h2>Tostadas De Tinga</h2>
            <p>Ingredients:<br>
                6 bone-in chicken breast halves<br>
                7 medium onions, thinly sliced<br>
                1 clove garlic, chopped<br>
                ¼ cup vegetable oil<br>
                6 medium tomatoes<br>
                1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce<br>
                1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules<br>
                16 tostada shells<br>
                1 cup sour cream<br>
                salt and pepper to taste <br>              
            </p>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <p>
                Place the chicken into a large pot along with 1/4 cup of sliced onion, garlic, and enough water to cover. <br>
                Bring to a boil, and cook until no longer pink, about 25 minutes. Remove chicken, cool, and shred meat. Discard skin and bones.<br>
                
                Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining onion slices, and fry until transparent.<br>
                Place tomatoes into a pan of boiling water (you could use the leftover chicken water), and boil until they split open.<br>
                
                Place the tomatoes, the whole can of chipotle peppers, chicken bouillon into a blender or large food processor.<br>
                Process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Pour this mixture into a large pan, and add the shredded chicken and cooked onions. Heat through.<br>
                
                To serve, each person spreads some sour cream on their tostada shell, and tops with a spoonful of the chicken.<br>

            <h2>Elotes</h2>
            <p>Ingredients:<br>
                6 to 8 medium ears sweet corn, husks removed<br>
                1/2 cup Mexican crema, or sour cream<br>
                1/2 cup mayonnaise<br>
                1/2 cup minced cilantro<br>
                1 clove garlic, minced<br>
                1/4 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper, to taste<br>
                2 teaspoons lime zest, from one lime<br>
                2 tablespoon lime juice, from one lime<br>
                1/2 cup cotija cheese, crumbled<br>
                Lime wedges, to serve<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <p>Heat a gas or charcoal grill to 400F:<br>
                Clean the grates once it has heated.<br>
                Whisk together the sauce:<br>
                In a bowl, whisk together the crema, mayonnaise, cilantro, garlic, chipotle pepper, lime zest and lime juice.<br> 
                Taste and season the mixture with salt if needed. (Crema has a little salt already, so add extra judiciously.) Set aside.<br>
                Grill the corn:<br>
                Place the husked corn directly onto grill grates. Grill the corn for about 3 minutes, undisturbed, or until kernels begin to turn golden brown and look charred. <br>
                Turn over and repeat. When all sides are browned, remove from the grill onto a plate.<br>
                Top the corn with sauce and cheese:<br>
                Using a brush or a spoon, coat each ear of corn with the crema mixture.<br>
                Sprinkle with crumbled cojita cheese. Sprinkle with additional chipotle pepper, if desired. Serve immediately with extra lime wedges.<br>
